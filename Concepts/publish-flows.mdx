title: "Publish flows"
---

Langflow provides several ways to publish and integrate your flows into external applications. Whether you want to expose your flow as an API endpoint, embed it as a chat widget in your website, or share it as a public playground, this guide covers the options available for making your flows accessible to users.

## **API access**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-publish#api-access)

The **API access** pane presents code templates for integrating your flow into external applications.

## **Temporary overrides**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-publish#temporary-overrides)

The **Temporary overrides** tab displays the available parameters for your flow. Modifying the parameters changes the code parameters across all windows. For example, changing the **Chat Input** component's `input_value` changes that value across all API calls to the `/run` endpoint of this flow.

### **Send files to your flow with the API**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-publish#send-files-to-your-flow-with-the-api)

For information on sending files to the Langflow API, see [Files endpoint](https://docs.langflow.org/api-files).

## **Shareable playground**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-publish#shareable-playground)

The **Shareable playground** exposes your Langflow application's **Playground** at the `/public_flow/$FLOW_ID` endpoint.

You can share this endpoint publicly using a sharing platform like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/?os=macos) or [zrok](https://docs.zrok.io/docs/getting-started).

If you're using **Datastax Langflow**, you can share the URL with any users within your **Organization**.

## **Embed into site**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-publish#embed-into-site)

The **Embed into site** tab displays code that can be inserted in the `<body>` of your HTML to interact with your flow.

For more information, see [Embedded chat widget](https://docs.langflow.org/embedded-chat-widget).
