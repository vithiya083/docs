The `host_url` value must be `HTTPS`, and may not include a `/` after the URL. The `flow_id` value is found in your Langflow URL. For a Langflow server running the [Basic prompting flow](https://docs.langflow.org/basic-prompting) at `https://c822-73-64-93-151.ngrok-free.app/flow/dcbed533-859f-4b99-b1f5-16fce884f28f`, your chat widget code is similar to the following:
