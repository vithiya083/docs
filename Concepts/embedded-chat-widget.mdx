title: "Embedded chat widget"
---

On the [Publish pane](/Concepts/publish-flows), the **Embed into site** tab displays code that can be inserted in the `<body>` of your HTML to interact with your flow.

The chat widget is implemented as a web component called `llmc-chat` and is loaded from a CDN. For more information, see the [llmc-embedded-chat repository](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow-embedded-chat).

For a sandbox example, see the [llmc embedded chat CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/langflow-embedded-chat-example-dv9zpx).

The following example includes the minimum required inputs, called [props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) in React, for using the chat widget in your HTML code, which are `host_url` and `flow_id`. The `host_url` value must be `HTTPS`, and may not include a `/` after the URL. The `flow_id` value is found in your LLMControls URL. For an LLMControls server running the [Basic prompting flow](/Templates/Basicprompting) at `https://c822-73-64-93-151.ngrok-free.app/flow/dcbed533-859f-4b99-b1f5-16fce884f28f`, your chat widget code is similar to the following:

When this code is embedded within HTML, it becomes a responsive chatbot, powered by the basic prompting flow.

To configure your chat widget further, include additional props.

All props and their types are listed in [index.tsx](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow-embedded-chat/blob/main/src/index.tsx).

To add some styling to the chat widget, customize its elements with JSON:

To add a custom [session ID](https://docs.langflow.org/session-id) value and an API key for authentication to your LLMControls server:

The chat widget requires your flow to contain **Chat Input** and **Chat Output** components for the widget to communicate with it. Sending a message to LLMControls that, without a **Chat Input,** still triggers the flow, but the LLM warns you that the message is empty. **Text Input** and **Text Output** components can send and receive messages with LLMControls, but without the ongoing LLM "chat" context.

## **Embed the chat widget with React**

To use the chat widget in your React application, create a component that loads the widget script and renders the chat interface:

1. Declare your web component and encapsulate it in a React component.
2. Place the component anywhere in your code to display the chat widget.

   For example, in this docset, the React widget component is located at `docs > src > components > ChatWidget > index.tsx`. `index.tsx` includes a script to load the chat widget code from CDN and initialize the `ChatWidget` component with props pointing to a LLMControls server.
3. To import the component to your page, add this to your site.
4. To add the widget to your page, include `<ChatWidget className="my-chat-widget" />`.

## **Embed the chat widget with Angular**

To use the chat widget in your [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview) application, create a component that loads the widget script and renders the chat interface.

Angular requires you to explicitly allow custom web components like `llmc-chat` in components, so you must add the `<llmc-chat>` element to your Angular template and configure Angular to recognize it. Add `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` to your module's configuration to enable this.

To add `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` to your module's configuration, do the following:

1. Open the module file `.module.ts` where you want to add the `llmc-chat` web component.
2. Import `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` at the top of the `.module.ts` file:

`import { NgModule, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';`

3. Add `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` to the `schemas` array inside the `@NgModule` decorator:
4. Add the chat widget to your component's template by including the `llmc-chat` element in your component's `.component.ts` file:

   For style properties that accept `JSON` objects like `chat_window_style` and `bot_message_style`, use Angular's property binding syntax `[propertyName]` to pass them as JavaScript objects.

Props with the type `JSON` need to be passed as stringified JSON (i.e., `'{"key":"value"}'`).
