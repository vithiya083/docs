Upload, store, and manage files in LLM Controls' **File management** system.

Uploading files to the **File management** system keeps your files in a central location and allows you to reuse files across flows without repeated manual uploads.

## **Upload a file**

The **File management** system is available at the `/files` URL. For example, if you're running LLM Controls at the default `http://localhost:7860` address, the **File management** system is located at `http://localhost:7860/files`.

To upload a file from your local machine:

1. From the **My Files** window at `http://localhost:7860/files`, click **Upload**.
2. Select the file to upload. The file is uploaded to LLM Controls.

You can upload multiple files in a single action. Files are available to flows stored in different projects.

Files stored in **My Files** can be renamed, downloaded, duplicated, or deleted.

To delete a file from your project, hover over a file's icon to click and select it, and then click **Delete**. You can delete multiple files in a single action.

To download a file from your project, hover over a file's icon to click and select it, and then click **Download**. You can download multiple files in a single action, but they will be saved together in a .ZIP file.

## **Use uploaded files in a flow**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-file-management#use-uploaded-files-in-a-flow)

To use your uploaded files in flows:

1. Include the [File](https://devrel.mintlify.app/Components/Data#file) component in a flow.
2. To select a document to load, in the **File** component, click the **Select files** button.
3. Select a file to upload, and then click **Select file**. The loaded file name appears in the component.

For an example of using the **File** component in a flow, see the [Document QA tutorial project](/Templates/DocumentQA).

<Note>
  NOTE

  If you prefer a one-time upload, the [<u>File</u>](https://devrel.mintlify.app/Components/Data#file) component still allows one-time uploads directly from your local machine.
