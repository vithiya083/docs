A component is a single building block within a flow with inputs, outputs, functions, and parameters that define its functionality. A single component is like a class within a larger application.

To add a component to a flow, drag it from the **Component** menu to the **Workspace**.

Learn more about components and how they work on this page.

## **Component menu**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-components#component-menu)

All components have a **Component menu** that contains meta settings for the component.

To access this menu for a specific component, select a component in a flow. The menu appears above the selected component.

You can use the controls in the **Component menu** to manage and configure the component on a high level, including the following actions:

- **Code**: Modify the component settings by directly editing the component's Python code.
- **Controls**: Adjust all component parameters, including optional settings that are hidden by default.
- **Tool Mode**: Enable tool mode when combining a component with an agent component.
- **Freeze**: After a component runs, lock its previous output state to prevent it from re-running.

Click **All** to see additional options for a component.

## **Component logs**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-components#component-logs)

To view a component's output and logs, click the icon.

## **Run one component**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-components#run-one-component)

To run a single component, click **Play**.

Running a single component with the **Play** button is different from running the entire flow. In a single component run, the `build_vertex` function is called, which builds and runs only the single component with direct inputs provided through the UI (the `inputs_dict` parameter). The `VertexBuildResult` data is passed to the `build_and_run` method, which calls the component's `build` method and runs it. Unlike running the full flow, running a single component does not automatically execute its upstream dependencies.

A **Checkmark** indicates that the component ran successfully.

## **Component ports**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-components#component-ports)

Handles () on the side of a component indicate the types of inputs and outputs that can be connected at that port. Hover over a handle to see connection details.
