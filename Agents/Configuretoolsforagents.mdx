Configure tools connected to agents to extend their capabilities.

## **Edit a tool component's actions**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/agents-tools#edit-a-tool-components-actions)

To edit a tool's actions, in the tool component, click **Edit Tools** to modify its `name`, `description`, or `enabled` metadata. These fields help connected agents understand how to use the action, without having to modify the agent's prompt instructions.

For example, the [URL](https://docs.langflow.org/components-data#url) component has two actions available when **Tool Mode** is enabled:

| **Tool Name**              | **Description**                          | **Enabled** |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :---------- |
| `fetch_content`            | Fetch content from web pages recursively | true        |
| `fetch_content_as_message` | Fetch web content formatted as messages  | true        |

A Langflow Agent has a clear idea of each tool's capabilities based on the `name` and `description` metadata. The `enabled` boolean controls the tool's availability to the agent. If you think an agent is using a tool incorrectly, edit a tool's `description` metadata to help the agent better understand the tool.

Tool names and descriptions can be edited, but the default tool identifiers cannot be changed. If you want to change the tool identifier, create a custom component.

## **Use an agent as a tool**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/agents-tools#use-an-agent-as-a-tool)

The agent component itself also supports **Tool Mode** for creating multi-agent flows.

Add an agent to your flow that uses a different OpenAI model for a larger context window.

1. Create the [Simple agent starter flow](https://docs.langflow.org/simple-agent).
2. Add a second agent component to the flow.
3. Add your **Open AI API Key** to the **Agent** component.
4. In the **Model Name** field, select `gpt-4.1`.
5. Click **Tool Mode** to use this new agent as a tool.

Connect the new agent's **Toolset** port to the previously created agent's **Tools** port. The new agent will use `gpt-4.1` for the larger tasks of scraping and searching information that require large context windows. The previously created agent will now use this agent as a tool, with its unique LLM and toolset.
