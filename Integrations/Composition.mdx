title: "Integrate Composio with LLMC"
---

LLMC integrates with [Composio](https://docs.composio.dev/introduction/intro/overview) as a toolset for your **Agent** component.

Instead of juggling multiple integrations and components in your flow, connect the Composio component to an **Agent** component to use all of Composio's supported APIs and actions as **Tools** for your agent.

## **Prerequisites**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/integrations-composio#prerequisites)

- [A Composio API key](https://app.composio.dev/)
- [An OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/)
- [A Gmail account](https://mail.google.com/)

## **Connect LLMC to a Composio tool**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/integrations-composio#connect-langflow-to-a-composio-tool)

1. In the LLMC **Workspace**, add an **Agent** component.
2. In the **Workspace**, add the **Composio Tools** component.
3. Connect the **Agent** component's **Tools** port to the **Composio Tools** component's **Tools** port.
4. In the **Composio API Key** field, paste your Composio API key. Alternatively, add the key as a global variable.
5. In the **Tool Name** field, select the tool you want your agent to have access to. For this example, select the **Gmail** tool, which allows your agent to control an email account with the Composio tool.
6. In the **Actions** field, select the action you want the **Agent** to take with the **Gmail** tool. The **Gmail** tool supports multiple actions, and also supports multiple actions within the same tool. For this example, select **GMAIL_CREATE_EMAIL_DRAFT**. For more information, see the [Composio documentation](https://docs.composio.dev/patterns/tools/use-tools/use-specific-actions).

## **Create a Composio flow**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/integrations-composio#create-a-composio-flow)

1. In the **Workspace**, add **Chat Input** and **Chat Output** components to your flow.
2. Connect the components so they look like this.

3. In the **OpenAI API Key** field of the **Agent** component, paste your OpenAI API key. Alternatively, add the key as a global variable.
4. To open the **Playground** pane, click **Playground**.
5. Ask your AI:

The response should be similar to:

This confirms your **Agent** and **Composio** are communicating.

6. Tell your AI to write a draft email.

Inspect the response to see how the agent used the attached tool to write an email. This example response is abbreviated.

7. To confirm further, navigate to the Gmail account you authenticated with Composio. Your email is visible in **Drafts**.

You have successfully integrated your LLMC component with Composio. To add more tools, add another Composio component.
