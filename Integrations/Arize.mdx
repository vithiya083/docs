title: "Integrate Arize with Langflow"
---

Arize is a tool built on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [OpenInference](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/reference/open-inference) for monitoring and optimizing LLM applications.

To add tracing to your Langflow application, add Arize environment variables to your Langflow application. Arize begins monitoring and collecting telemetry data from your LLM applications automatically.

## **Prerequisites**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/integrations-arize#prerequisites)

- If you are using the [standard Arize platform](https://docs.arize.com/arize), you need an **Arize Space ID** and **Arize API Key**.
- If you are using the open-source [Arize Phoenix platform](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix), you need an **Arize Phoenix API key**.

## **Run a flow and view metrics in Arize**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/integrations-arize#run-a-flow-and-view-metrics-in-arize)

1. In Langflow, select the [Simple agent](https://docs.langflow.org/simple-agent) starter project.
2. In the **Agent** component's **OpenAI API Key** field, paste your **OpenAI API key**.
3. Click **Playground**. Ask your Agent some questions to generate traffic.
4. Navigate to the [Arize dashboard](https://app.arize.com/), and then open your project. You may have to wait a few minutes for Arize to process the data.
5. The **LLM Tracing** tab shows metrics for your flow. Each Langflow execution generates two traces in Arize. The `AgentExecutor` trace is the Arize trace of Langchain's `AgentExecutor`. The UUID trace is the trace of the Langflow components.
6. To view traces, click the **Traces** tab. A **trace** is the complete journey of a request, made of multiple **spans**.
7. To view **Spans**, select the **Spans** tab. A **span** is a single operation within a trace. For example, a **span** could be a single API call to OpenAI or a single function call to a custom tool. For more on traces, spans, and other metrics in Arize, see the [Arize documentation](https://docs.arize.com/arize/llm-tracing/tracing).
8. All metrics in the **LLM Tracing** tab can be added to **Datasets**. To add a span to a **Dataset**, click the **Add to Dataset** button.
9. To view a **Dataset**, click the **Datasets** tab, and then select your **Dataset**. For more on **Datasets**, see the [Arize documentation](https://docs.arize.com/arize/llm-datasets-and-experiments/datasets-and-experiments).
