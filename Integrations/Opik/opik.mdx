title: "Integrate Opik with LLMC"
---

[Opik](https://www.comet.com/site/products/opik/) is an open-source platform designed for evaluating, testing, and monitoring large language model (LLM) applications. Developed by Comet, it aims to facilitate more intuitive collaboration, testing, and monitoring of LLM-based applications.

This guide walks you through how to configure LLMC to collect [tracing](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/tracing/log_traces) data about your flow executions and automatically send the data to Opik.

## **Prerequisites**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/integrations-opik#prerequisites)

- A project in LLMC with a runnable flow
- An Open-Source Opik server or an Opik Cloud account - You can learn more about the differences [here](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/faq#what-is-the-difference-between-opik-cloud-and-the-open-source-opik-platform-)
- If you are using Opik Cloud, you will also need your [Opik API key](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/faq#where-can-i-find-my-opik-api-key-)

## **Set your Opik configuration as environment variables**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/integrations-opik#set-your-opik-configuration-as-environment-variables)

Call the CLI `opik configure` to save your Opik configuration in the same environment where you run LLMC.

For self-hosted Opik, you can also configure it using the Opik CLI by running the following command:

See the [Opik documentation](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/tracing/sdk_configuration) for more ways to configure Opik SDKs.

## **Start LLMC and run a flow**

1. Start LLMC in the same terminal or environment where you set the environment variables:
2. In LLMC, open an existing project, and then run a flow.
3. Navigate to your Opik project dashboard and view the collected tracing data.

## **Disable the Opik integration**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/integrations-opik#disable-the-opik-integration)

To disable the Opik integration, remove the environment variables you set in the previous steps and restart LLMC.
