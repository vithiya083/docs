title: "Tool components in Langflow"
---

Tools are typically connected to agent components at the **Tools** port. Agents use LLMs as a reasoning engine to decide which of the connected tool components to use to solve a problem.

Tools in agentic functions are, essentially, functions that the agent can call to perform tasks or access external resources. A function is wrapped as a `Tool` object, with a common interface the agent understands. Agents become aware of tools through tool registration, where the agent is provided a list of available tools, typically at agent initialization. The `Tool` object's description tells the agent what the tool can do.

The agent then uses a connected LLM to reason through the problem to decide which tool is best for the job.

## **Use a tool in a flow**

Tools are typically connected to agent components at the **Tools** port.

The [simple agent starter project](https://docs.langflow.org/simple-agent) uses URL and Calculator tools connected to an [agent component](https://docs.langflow.org/components-agents#agent-component) to answer a user's questions. The OpenAI LLM acts as a brain for the agent to decide which tool to use.

To make a component into a tool that an agent can use, enable **Tool Mode** in the component. Enabling tool mode modifies a component input to accept calls from an agent. If the component you want to connect to an agent doesn't have a **Tool Mode** option, you can modify the component's inputs to become a tool. For an example, see [Make any component a tool](https://docs.langflow.org/agents-tools#make-any-component-a-tool).

## **arXiv**

This component searches and retrieves papers from [arXiv.org](http://arXiv.org).

## **Astra DB tool**

This component allows agents to query data from Astra DB collections.

To use this tool in a flow, connect it to an **Agent** component. The flow looks like this:

# image

The **Tool Name** and **Tool Description** fields are required for the Agent to decide when to use the tool. **Tool Name** cannot contain spaces.

The values for **Collection Name**, **Astra DB Application Token**, and **Astra DB API Endpoint** are found in your Astra DB deployment. For more information, see the [DataStax documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/create-database.html).

In this example, an **OpenAI** embeddings component is connected to use the Astra DB tool component's **Semantic Search** capability. To use **Semantic Search**, you must have an embedding model or Astra DB Vectorize enabled. If you try to run the flow without an embedding model, you will get an error.

Open the **Playground** and ask a question about your data. The Agent uses the **Astra DB Tool** to return information about your collection.

### **Define Astra DB tool parameters**

The **Tool Parameters** configuration pane allows you to define parameters for [filter conditions](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/api-reference/document-methods/find-many.html#parameters) for the component's **Find** command.

These filters become available as parameters that the LLM can use when calling the tool, with a better understanding of each parameter provided by the **Description** field.

1. To define a parameter for your query, in the **Tool Parameters** pane, click **Add a new row**.
2. Complete the fields based on your data. For example, with this filter, the LLM can filter by unique `customer_id` values.

- Name: `customer_id`
- Attribute Name: Leave empty if the attribute matches the field name in the database.
- Description: `"The unique identifier of the customer to filter by"`.
- Is Metadata: `False` unless the value stored in the metadata field.
- Is Mandatory: `True` to require this filter.
- Is Timestamp: `False` since the value is an ID, not a timestamp.
- Operator: `$eq` to look for an exact match.

If you want to apply filters regardless of the LLM's input, use the **Static Filters** option, which is available in the component's **Controls** pane.

| **Parameter**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name           | The name of the parameter that is exposed to the LLM. It can be the same as the underlying field name or a more descriptive label. The LLM uses this name, along with the description, to infer what value to provide during execution.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Attribute Name | When the parameter name shown to the LLM differs from the actual field or property in the database, use this setting to map the user-facing name to the correct attribute. For example, to apply a range filter to the timestamp field, define two separate parameters, such as `start_date` and `end_date`, that both reference the same timestamp attribute.                                    |
| Description    | Provides instructions to the LLM on how the parameter should be used. Clear and specific guidance helps the LLM provide valid input. For example, if a field such as `specialty` is stored in lowercase, the description should indicate that the input must be lowercase.                                                                                                                        |
| Is Metadata    | When loading data using LangChain or Langflow, additional attributes may be stored under a metadata object. If the target attribute is stored this way, enable this option. It adjusts the query by generating a filter in the format: `{"metadata.<attribute_name>": "<value>"}`                                                                                                                 |
| Is Timestamp   | For date or time-based filters, enable this option to automatically convert values to the timestamp format that the Astrapy client expects. This ensures compatibility with the underlying API without requiring manual formatting.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Operator       | Defines the filtering logic applied to the attribute. You can use any valid [Data API filter operator](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/api-reference/filter-operator-collections.html). For example, to filter a time range on the timestamp attribute, use two parameters: one with the `$gt` operator for "greater than", and another with the `$lt` operator for "less than". |
