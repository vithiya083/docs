# Data Components

Data components load data from a source into your flow. 

They may perform some processing or type checking, like converting raw HTML data into text, or ensuring your loaded file is of an acceptable type.

## **Use a data component in a flow**

The **URL** data component loads content from a list of URLs.

     In the component's **URLs** field, enter the URL you want to load

     To add multiple URL fields, click the add button

      Alternatively, connect a component that outputs the `Message` type, like the **Chat Input**              component, to supply your URLs from a component

## API Request Component

This component makes HTTP requests using URLs or cURL commands.

### Setup Instructions

2. In the API component's **URLs** field, enter the endpoint for your request
3. In the **Method** field, enter the type of request (GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, or DELETE)
4. Optionally, enable the **Use cURL** button to create a field for pasting curl requests
5. Click **Playground**, then click **Run Flow** to execute your request

## URL 

This component fetches content from one or more URLs, processes the content, and returns it in various formats. It supports output in plain text or raw HTML.

In the component's **URLs** field, enter the URL you want to load

1. To use this component in a flow, connect the **DataFrame** output to a component that accepts the input. For example, connect the **URL** component to a **Chat Output** component.

2. In the URL component's **URLs** field, enter the URL for your request. This example uses `langflow.org`.
3. Optionally, in the **Max Depth** field, enter how many pages away from the initial URL you want to crawl. Select `1` to crawl only the page specified in the **URLs** field. Select `2` to crawl all pages linked from that page. The component crawls by link traversal, not by URL path depth.
4. Click **Playground**, and then click **Run Flow**. The text contents of the URL are returned to the Playground as a structured DataFrame.
5. In the **URL** component, change the output port to **Message**, and then run the flow again. The text contents of the URL are returned as unstructured raw text, which you can extract patterns from with the **Regex Extractor** tool.
6. Connect the **URL** component to a **Regex Extractor** and **Chat Output**.
