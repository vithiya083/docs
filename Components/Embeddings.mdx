title: "Embeddings models in Langflow"
---

Embeddings models convert text into numerical vectors. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the input text, and allow LLMs to understand context.

Refer to your specific component's documentation for more information on parameters.

## **Use an embeddings model component in a flow**[**â€‹**](https://docs.langflow.org/components-embedding-models#use-an-embeddings-model-component-in-a-flow)

In this example of a document ingestion pipeline, the **OpenAI** embeddings model is connected to a vector database. The component converts the text chunks into vectors and stores them in the vector database. The vectorized data can be used to inform AI workloads like chatbots, similarity searches, and agents.

This embeddings component uses an OpenAI API key for authentication. Refer to your specific embeddings component's documentation for more information on authentication.
