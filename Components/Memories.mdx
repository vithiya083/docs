title: "Memory components in Langflow"
---

Memory components store and retrieve chat messages by `session_id`.

They are distinct from vector store components, because they are built specifically for storing and retrieving chat messages from external databases.

Memory components provide access to their respective external databases **as memory**. This allows Large Language Models (LLMs) or [agents](https://docs.langflow.org/components-agents) to access external memory for persistence and context retention.

## **Use a memory component in a flow**[**â€‹**](https://docs.langflow.org/components-memories#use-a-memory-component-in-a-flow)

This example flow stores and retrieves chat history from an **Astra DB Chat Memory** component with **Store Message** and **Message history** components.

The **Store Message** helper component stores chat memories as [Data](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects) objects, and the **Message History** helper component retrieves chat messages as [Data](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects) objects or strings.
