Processing components process and transform data within a flow.

## **Use a processing component in a flow**

The **Split Text** processing component in this flow splits the incoming [Data](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects) into chunks to be embedded into the vector store component.

The component offers control over chunk size, overlap, and separator, which affect context and granularity in vector store retrieval results.

## **DataFrame operations**

This component performs operations on [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) rows and columns.

To use this component in a flow, connect a component that outputs [DataFrame](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects#dataframe-object) to the **DataFrame Operations** component.

This example fetches JSON data from an API. The **Smart function** component extracts and flattens the results into a tabular DataFrame. The **DataFrame Operations** component can then work with the retrieved data.

# image

1. The **API Request** component retrieves data with only `source` and `result` fields. For this example, the desired data is nested within the `result` field.
2. Connect a **Smart function** to the API request component, and a **Language model** to the **Smart function**. This example connects a **Groq** model component.
3. In the **Groq** model component, add your **Groq** API key.
4. To filter the data, in the **Smart function** component, in the **Instructions** field, use natural language to describe how the data should be filtered. For this example, enter:

<Tip>
  TIP

  Avoid punctuation in the **Instructions** field, as it can cause errors.
</Tip>

5. To run the flow, in the **Smart function** component, click **Run component**.
6. To inspect the filtered data, in the **Smart function** component, click **Inspect output**. The result is a structured DataFrame.


 7. Add the **DataFrame Operations** component, and a **Chat Output** component to the flow.
 8. In the **DataFrame Operations** component, in the **Operation** field, select **Filter**.
 9. To apply a filter, in the **Column Name** field, enter a column to filter on. This example filters by `name`.
10. Click **Playground**, and then click **Run Flow**. The flow extracts the values from the `name` column.

```
```

| Rename Column  | column_name, new_column_name                  | Renames an existing column.              |
| Replace Value  | column_name, replace_value, replacement_value | Replaces values in a column.             |
| Select Columns | columns_to_select                             | Selects specific columns.                |
| Sort           | column_name, ascending                        | Sorts DataFrame by column.               |
| Tail           | num_rows                                      | Returns last `n` rows.                   |

## **Data operations**

This component performs operations on [Data](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects#data-object) objects, including selecting keys, evaluating literals, combining data, filtering values, appending/updating data, removing keys, and renaming keys.

1. To use this component in a flow, connect a component that outputs [Data](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects#data-object) to the **Data Operations** component's input. All operations in the component require at least one [Data](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects#data-object) input.
2. In the **Operations** field, select the operation you want to perform. For example, send this request to the **Webhook** component. Replace `YOUR_FLOW_ID` with your flow ID.

```
```

   3. In the **Data Operations** component, select the **Select Keys** operation to extract specific user information. To add additional keys, click **Add More**.

# image

4. Filter by `name`, `username`, and `email` to select the values from the request.

```
```

### **Operations**

The component supports the following operations. All operations in the **Data operations** component require at least one [Data](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects#data-object) input.

| **Operation**    | **Required Inputs**                       | **Info**                                    |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Select Keys      | `select_keys_input`                       | Selects specific keys from the data.        |
| Literal Eval     | None                                      | Evaluates string values as Python literals. |
| Combine          | None                                      | Combines multiple data objects into one.    |
| Filter Values    | `filter_key`, `filter_values`, `operator` | Filters data based on key-value pair.       |
| Append or Update | `append_update_data`                      | Adds or updates key-value pairs.            |
| Remove Keys      | `remove_keys_input`                       | Removes specified keys from the data.       |
| Rename Keys      | `rename_keys_input`                       | Renames keys in the data.                   |

Parameters

## **Data to DataFrame**

This component converts one or multiple [Data](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects#data-object) objects into a [DataFrame](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects#dataframe-object). Each Data object corresponds to one row in the resulting DataFrame. Fields from the `.data` attribute become columns, and the `.text` field (if present) is placed in a 'text' column.

1. To use this component in a flow, connect a component that outputs [Data](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects#data-object) to the **Data to Dataframe** component's input. This example connects a **Webhook** component to convert `text` and `data` into a DataFrame.
2. To view the flow's output, connect a **Chat Output** component to the **Data to Dataframe** component.

# image

3. Send a POST request to the **Webhook** containing your JSON data. Replace `YOUR_FLOW_ID` with your flow ID. This example uses the default Langflow server address.

```
```

4. In the **Playground**, view the output of your flow. The **Data to DataFrame** component converts the webhook request into a `DataFrame`, with `text` and `data` fields as columns.

```
```

5. Send another employee data object.

```
```

6. In the **Playground**, this request is also converted to `DataFrame`.

```
```
