Processing components process and transform data within a flow.

## **Use a processing component in a flow**

The **Split Text** processing component in this flow splits the incoming [Data](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects) into chunks to be embedded into the vector store component.

The component offers control over chunk size, overlap, and separator, which affect context and granularity in vector store retrieval results.

## **DataFrame operations**

This component performs operations on [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) rows and columns.

To use this component in a flow, connect a component that outputs [DataFrame](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects#dataframe-object) to the **DataFrame Operations** component.

This example fetches JSON data from an API. The **Smart function** component extracts and flattens the results into a tabular DataFrame. The **DataFrame Operations** component can then work with the retrieved data.

1. The **API Request** component retrieves data with only `source` and `result` fields. For this example, the desired data is nested within the `result` field.
2. Connect a **Smart function** to the API request component, and a **Language model** to the **Smart function**. This example connects a **Groq** model component.
3. In the **Groq** model component, add your **Groq** API key.
4. To filter the data, in the **Smart function** component, in the **Instructions** field, use natural language to describe how the data should be filtered. For this example, enter:

```
```

<Tip>
  TIP

  Avoid punctuation in the **Instructions** field, as it can cause errors.
</Tip>

5. To run the flow, in the **Smart function** component, click **Run component**.
6. To inspect the filtered data, in the **Smart function** component, click **Inspect output**. The result is a structured DataFrame.

```
```

 7. Add the **DataFrame Operations** component, and a **Chat Output** component to the flow.
 8. In the **DataFrame Operations** component, in the **Operation** field, select **Filter**.
 9. To apply a filter, in the **Column Name** field, enter a column to filter on. This example filters by `name`.
10. Click **Playground**, and then click **Run Flow**. The flow extracts the values from the `name` column.
