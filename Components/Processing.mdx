Processing components process and transform data within a flow.

## **Use a processing component in a flow**

The **Split Text** processing component in this flow splits the incoming [Data](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects) into chunks to be embedded into the vector store component.

The component offers control over chunk size, overlap, and separator, which affect context and granularity in vector store retrieval results.

## **DataFrame operations**

This component performs operations on [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) rows and columns.

To use this component in a flow, connect a component that outputs [DataFrame](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects#dataframe-object) to the **DataFrame Operations** component.

This example fetches JSON data from an API. The **Smart function** component extracts and flattens the results into a tabular DataFrame. The **DataFrame Operations** component can then work with the retrieved data.

# image

1. The **API Request** component retrieves data with only `source` and `result` fields. For this example, the desired data is nested within the `result` field.
2. Connect a **Smart function** to the API request component, and a **Language model** to the **Smart function**. This example connects a **Groq** model component.
3. In the **Groq** model component, add your **Groq** API key.
4. To filter the data, in the **Smart function** component, in the **Instructions** field, use natural language to describe how the data should be filtered. For this example, enter:

<Tip>
  TIP

  Avoid punctuation in the **Instructions** field, as it can cause errors.
</Tip>

 5. To run the flow, in the **Smart function** component, click **Run component**.
 6. To inspect the filtered data, in the **Smart function** component, click **Inspect output**. The result is a structured DataFrame.
 7. Add the **DataFrame Operations** component, and a **Chat Output** component to the flow.
 8. In the **DataFrame Operations** component, in the **Operation** field, select **Filter**.
 9. To apply a filter, in the **Column Name** field, enter a column to filter on. This example filters by `name`.
10. Click **Playground**, and then click **Run Flow**. The flow extracts the values from the `name` column.

## **Parser**

This component formats `DataFrame` or `Data` objects into text using templates, with an option to convert inputs directly to strings using `stringify`.

To use this component, create variables for values in the `template` the same way you would in a [Prompt](https://docs.langflow.org/components-prompts) component. For `DataFrames`, use column names, for example `Name: {Name}`. For `Data` objects, use `{text}`.

To use the **Parser** component with a **Structured Output** component, do the following:

1. Connect a **Structured Output** component's **DataFrame** output to the **Parser** component's **DataFrame** input.
2. Connect the **File** component to the **Structured Output** component's **Message** input.
3. Connect the **OpenAI** model component's **Language Model** output to the **Structured Output** component's **Language Model** input.

The flow looks like this:

# image

4. In the **Structured Output** component, click **Open Table**. This opens a pane for structuring your table. The table contains the rows **Name**, **Description**, **Type**, and **Multiple**.
5. Create a table that maps to the data you're loading from the **File** loader. For example, to create a table for employees, you might have the rows `id`, `name`, and `email`, all of type `string`.
6. In the **Template** field of the **Parser** component, enter a template for parsing the **Structured Output** component's DataFrame output into structured text. Create variables for values in the `template` the same way you would in a [Prompt](https://docs.langflow.org/components-prompts) component. For example, to present a table of employees in Markdown:
7. To run the flow, in the **Parser** component, click **Run component**.
8. To view your parsed text, in the **Parser** component, click **Inspect output**.
9. Optionally, connect a **Chat Output** component, and open the **Playground** to see the output.

## **Save to File**

This component saves [DataFrames, Data, or Messages](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects) to various file formats.

1. To use this component in a flow, connect a component that outputs [DataFrames, Data, or Messages](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects) to the **Save to File** component's input. The following example connects a **Webhook** component to two **Save to File** components to demonstrate the different outputs.

# image

2. In the **Save to File** component's **Input Type** field, select the expected input type. This example expects **Data** from the **Webhook**.
3. In the **File Format** field, select the file type for your saved file. This example uses `.md` in one **Save to File** component, and `.xlsx` in another.
4. In the **File Path** field, enter the path for your saved file. This example uses `./output/employees.xlsx` and `./output/employees.md` to save the files in a directory relative to where Langflow is running. The component accepts both relative and absolute paths, and creates any necessary directories if they don't exist.

<Tip>
  **tip**

  If you enter a format in the `file_path` that is not accepted, the component appends the proper format to the file. For example, if the selected `file_format` is `csv`, and you enter `file_path` as `./output/test.txt`, the file is saved as `./output/test.txt.csv` so the file is not corrupted.
</Tip>

5. Send a POST request to the **Webhook** containing your JSON data. Replace `YOUR_FLOW_ID` with your flow ID. This example uses the default Langflow server address.
6. In your local filesystem, open the `outputs` directory. You should see two files created from the data you've sent: one in `.xlsx` for structured spreadsheets, and one in Markdown.

### **File input format options**

For `DataFrame` and `Data` inputs, the component can create:

- `csv`
- `excel`
- `json`
- `markdown`
- `pdf`

For `Message` inputs, the component can create:

- `txt`
- `json`
- `markdown`
- `pdf`
