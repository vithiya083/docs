Logic components provide functionalities for routing, conditional processing, and flow management.

## **Use a logic component in a flow**[**â€‹**](https://docs.langflow.org/components-logic#use-a-logic-component-in-a-flow)

This flow creates a summarizing "for each" loop with the [Loop](https://docs.langflow.org/components-logic#loop) component.

The component iterates over a list of [Data](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects#data-object) objects until it's completed, and then the **Done** loop aggregates the results.

The **File** component loads text files from your local machine, and then the **Parser** component parses them into a list of structured `Data` objects. The **Loop** component passes each `Data` object to a **Prompt** to be summarized.

When the **Loop** component runs out of `Data`, the **Done** loop activates, which counts the number of pages and summarizes their tone with another **Prompt**. This is represented in Langflow by connecting the Parser component's **Data List** output to the Loop component's `Data` loop input.

The output is similar to this:

## **Conditional router (If-Else component)**

This component routes messages by comparing two strings. It evaluates a condition by comparing two text inputs using the specified operator and routes the message to `true_result` or `false_result`.

The operator looks for single strings based on your defined [operator behavior](https://docs.langflow.org/components-logic#operator-behavior), but it can also search for multiple words by regex matching.

To use the **Conditional router** component to check incoming messages with regex matching, do the following:

1. Connect the **If-Else** component's **Text Input** port to a **Chat Input** component.
2. In the If-Else component, enter the following values.

- In the **Match Text** field, enter `.*(urgent|warning|caution).*`. The component looks for these values. The regex match is case sensitive, so to look for all permutations of `warning`, enter `warning|Warning|WARNING`.
- In the **Operator** field, enter `regex`. The component looks for the strings `urgent`, `warning`, and `caution`. For more operators, see [Operator behavior](https://docs.langflow.org/components-logic#operator-behavior).
- In the **Message** field, enter `New Message Detected`. This field is optional. The message is sent to both the **True** and **False** ports. The component is now set up to send a `New Message Detected` message out of its **True** port if it matches any of the strings. If no strings are detected, it sends a message out of the **False** port.

3. Create two identical flows to process the messages. Connect an **Open AI** component, a **Prompt**, and a **Chat Output** component together.
4. Connect one chain to the **If-Else** component's **True** port, and one chain to the **False** port.

The flow looks like this:

5. Add your **OpenAI API key** to both **OpenAI** components.
6. In both **Prompt** components, enter the behavior you want each route to take. When a match is found:

```
```

When a match is not found:

```
```

7. Open the **Playground**.
8. Send the flow some messages. Your messages route differently based on the if-else component's evaluation.

```
```
