title: "Vector store components in Langflow"
---

Vector databases store vector data, which backs AI workloads like chatbots and Retrieval Augmented Generation.

Vector database components establish connections to existing vector databases or create in-memory vector stores for storing and retrieving vector data.

Vector database components are distinct from [memory components](https://docs.langflow.org/components-memories), which are built specifically for storing and retrieving chat messages from external databases.

## **Use a vector store component in a flow**

This example uses the **Astra DB vector store** component. Your vector store component's parameters and authentication may be different, but the document ingestion workflow is the same. A document is loaded from a local machine and chunked. The Astra DB vector store generates embeddings with the connected [model](https://docs.langflow.org/components-models) component, and stores them in the connected Astra DB database.

This vector data can then be retrieved for workloads like Retrieval Augmented Generation..

The user's chat input is embedded and compared to the vectors embedded during document ingestion for a similarity search. The results are output from the vector database component as a [Data](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects) object and parsed into text. This text fills the `{context}` variable in the **Prompt** component, which informs the **Open AI model** component's responses.

Alternatively, connect the vector database component's **Retriever** port to a [retriever tool](https://docs.langflow.org/components-tools#retriever-tool), and then to an [agent](https://docs.langflow.org/components-agents) component. This enables the agent to use your vector database as a tool and make decisions based on the available data.

## **Astra DB Vector Store**

This component implements a Vector Store using Astra DB with search capabilities.

For more information, see the [DataStax documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/create-database.html).

### **Generate embeddings**

The **Astra DB Vector Store** component offers two methods for generating embeddings.

1. **Embedding Model**: Use your own embedding model by connecting an [Embeddings](https://docs.langflow.org/components-embedding-models) component in Langflow.
2. **Astra Vectorize**: Use Astra DB's built-in embedding generation service. When creating a new collection, choose the embeddings provider and models, including NVIDIA's `NV-Embed-QA` model hosted by Datastax.

<Note>
  **important**

  The embedding model selection is made when creating a new collection and cannot be changed later.
</Note>

For an example of using the **Astra DB Vector Store** component with an embedding model, see the [Vector Store RAG starter project](https://docs.langflow.org/vector-store-rag).

For more information, see the [Astra DB Serverless documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/embedding-generation.html).

### **Hybrid search**

The **Astra DB** component includes **hybrid search**, which is enabled by default.

The component fields related to hybrid search are **Search Query**, **Lexical Terms**, and **Reranker**.

- **Search Query** finds results by vector similarity.
- **Lexical Terms** is a comma-separated string of keywords, like `features, data, attributes, characteristics`.
- **Reranker** is the re-ranker model used in the hybrid search. The re-ranker model is `nvidia/llama-3.2-nv.reranker`.

[Hybrid search](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/hybrid-search.html) performs a vector similarity search and a lexical search, compares the results of both searches, and then returns the most relevant results overall.

<Note>
  **important**

  To use hybrid search, your collection must be created with vector, lexical, and rerank capabilities enabled. These capabilities are enabled by default when you create a collection in a database in the AWS us-east-2 region. For more information, see the [<u>DataStax documentation</u>](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/api-reference/collection-methods/create-collection.html#example-hybrid).
</Note>

To use **Hybrid search** in the **Astra DB** component, do the following:

1. Click **New Flow** \> **RAG** \> **Hybrid Search RAG**.
2. In the **OpenAI** model component, add your **OpenAI API key**.
3. In the **Astra DB** vector store component, add your **Astra DB Application Token**.
4. In the **Database** field, select your database.
5. In the **Collection** field, select or create a collection with hybrid search capabilities enabled.
6. In the **Playground**, enter a question about your data, such as `What are the features of my data?` Your query is sent to two components: an **OpenAI** model component and the **Astra DB** vector database component. The **OpenAI** component contains a prompt for creating the lexical query from your input:
7. To view the keywords and questions the **OpenAI** component generates from your collection, in the **OpenAI** component, click **Inspect output**.
8. To view the [DataFrame](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-objects#dataframe-object) generated from the **OpenAI** component's response, in the **Structured Output** component, click **Inspect output**. The DataFrame is passed to a **Parser** component, which parses the contents of the **Keywords** column into a string.

   This string of comma-separated words is passed to the **Lexical Terms** port of the **Astra DB** component. Note that the **Search Query** port of the Astra DB port is connected to the **Chat Input** component from step 6. This **Search Query** is vectorized, and both the **Search Query** and **Lexical Terms** content are sent to the reranker at the `find_and_rerank` endpoint.

   The reranker compares the vector search results against the string of terms from the lexical search. The highest-ranked results of your hybrid search are returned to the **Playground**.

For more information, see the [DataStax documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/databases/hybrid-search.html).

## **AstraDB Graph vector store**

## **Chroma DB**

This component creates a Chroma Vector Store with search capabilities.

The Chroma DB component creates an ephemeral vector database for experimentation and vector storage.

1. To use this component in a flow, connect it to a component that outputs **Data** or **DataFrame**. This example splits text from a [URL](https://docs.langflow.org/components-data#url) component, and computes embeddings with the connected **OpenAI Embeddings** component. Chroma DB computes embeddings by default, but you can connect your own embeddings model, as seen in this example.

# image

2. In the **Chroma DB** component, in the **Collection** field, enter a name for your embeddings collection.
3. Optionally, to persist the Chroma database, in the **Persist** field, enter a directory to store the `chroma.sqlite3` file. This example uses `./chroma-db` to create a directory relative to where Langflow is running.
4. To load data and embeddings into your Chroma database, in the **Chroma DB** component, click **Run component**.

<Tip>
  **tip**

  When loading duplicate documents, enable the **Allow Duplicates** option in Chroma DB if you want to store multiple copies of the same content, or disable it to automatically deduplicate your data.
</Tip>

5. To view the split data, in the **Split Text** component, click **Inspect output**.
6. To query your loaded data, open the **Playground** and query your database. Your input is converted to vector data and compared to the stored vectors in a vector similarity search.

For more information, see the [Chroma documentation](https://docs.trychroma.com/).

The **Ingest** mode works similarly to [ChromaDB](https://docs.langflow.org/components-vector-stores#chroma-db), and persists your database to the Langflow cache directory. The Langflow cache directory location is specified in `LANGFLOW_CONFIG_DIR`. For more information, see [Environment variables](https://docs.langflow.org/environment-variables).

The **Retrieve** mode can query your **Chroma DB** collections.
