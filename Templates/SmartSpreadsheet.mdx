Build a **Simple Agent** flow for an agentic application using the agent component.

An **agent** uses an LLM as its "brain" to select among the connected tools and complete its tasks.

In this flow, the **Tool-calling agent** reasons using an **OpenAI** LLM. The agent selects the **Calculator** tool for simple math problems and the **URL** tool to search a URL for content.

## **Prerequisites**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/simple-agent#prerequisites)

- [An OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/)

## **Open LLM Controls and start a new flow**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/simple-agent#open-langflow-and-start-a-new-flow)

Click **New Flow**, and then select the **Simple Agent** flow.

This opens a starter flow with the necessary components to run an agentic application using the Tool-calling agent.

## **Simple Agent flow**

The **Simple Agent** flow consists of these components:

- The **Tool calling agent** component uses the connected LLM to reason through the user's input and select among the connected tools to complete its task.
- The **URL** tool component searches a list of URLs for content.
- The **Calculator** component performs basic arithmetic operations.
- The **Chat Input** component accepts user input to the chat.
- The **Chat Output** component prints the flow's output to the chat.

## **Run the Simple Agent flow**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/simple-agent#run-the-simple-agent-flow)

1. Add your credentials to the **Agent** component.
2. Click **Playground** to start a chat session.
3. To confirm the tools are connected, ask the agent, `What tools are available to you?` The response is similar to the following:
4. Ask the agent a question. For example, ask it to create a tabletop character using your favorite rules set. The agent tells you when it's using the `URL-fetch_content_text` tool to search for rules information, and when it's using `CalculatorComponent-evaluate_expression` to generate attributes with dice rolls. The final output should be similar to this:

Now that your query has completed the journey from **Chat input** to **Chat output**, you have completed the **Simple Agent** flow.
