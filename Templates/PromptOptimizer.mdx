The Prompt Optimizer template automatically improves your prompts by generating variations, testing them against evaluation criteria, scoring responses, and ranking results - all handled by a single optimization engine.

This template helps you find the best-performing prompt for any task without manual trial and error.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with LLMC components

## Create the Prompt Optimizer Flow

### 1. Enter Your Task

Start with the LLMC Prompt Optimizer component (left side of the workspace).

Steps:

- Enter a clear task or base prompt in the User Task Input field.
- Select the model you want your prompt to be optimized by using the Chosen Model.

Example: "Summarize news articles concisely for a mobile app."

### 2. Run the Optimization

Click Run on the Results node (right side) to trigger the full optimization pipeline.

What happens behind the scenes:

- Generates structured prompt variations from your task.
- Creates test cases to evaluate prompts fairly and consistently.
- Builds scoring criteria like clarity, relevance, tone, and completeness.
- Generates answers from each prompt variation using the selected model.
- Scores and ranks each output against the evaluation criteria.

### 3. Review Results

The Results component aggregates scores and displays a ranked leaderboard.

- View the Leaderboard to compare prompt performance across all models selected.
- Use Select Prompt/Model to choose the top-performing prompt for use.

## Modify or Extend

- Change the task description to optimize prompts for different use cases.
- Select different models to compare how prompts perform across providers.
- Use the selected prompt in LLMC Executor within other templates like Vector Store RAG or Targeted FAQ.
