The Summarization and Aggregation template enhances the basic summarization workflow by integrating Prompt Optimization and LLMC Executor capabilities.

\
This template enables you to upload documents, generate summaries, automatically optimize prompts, and evaluate the best-performing versions, all within one seamless LLM Controls workflow.

## Prerequisites

- An OpenAI API Key
-  A structured document (PDF) for upload
-  Basic familiarity with LLM Controls Flows

## Create the Advanced Summarization Flow

### 1. Upload a File

From the File component:

- Upload your document (PDF format supported)
- This component outputs both raw and parsed data
- Output is automatically passed to the Parser component

### 2. Parse the Document

The Parser component converts uploaded content into plain text.

- Mode: Parser
- Template: Define how content is extracted (e.g., Text: text)\
  This ensures your data is clean and ready for prompting

### 3. Optimize the Summarization Prompt

Use the Prompt Optimizer Flow to automatically refine your prompt.

- Input a summarization task, such as:\
  **“Summarize uploaded documents into concise, professional summaries.”**
- The optimizer generates **multiple prompt variations, test cases, and evaluation metrics.**
- Outputs include ranked prompts based on clarity, effectiveness, and consistency.

Click the Prompt Optimizer Flow node in the workspace to open and run this optimization process.

### 4. Execute with LLMC Executor

\
The LLMC Executor allows you to run the best-performing prompts with a chosen AI model.

- **Model Selection**: Choose from GPT models (e.g., gpt-4o)
- **Prompt Selection:** Pick from optimized prompts generated earlier
- **API Key:** Enter your valid OpenAI key in the custom_api_key field

Then click Run to execute and generate the summarized output.

### 5. View the Summary Output

The Summary Output component displays the final, aggregated summary in a clean text format.\
You can review, copy, or export it directly from the Playground.

## Modify or Extend

- To change the summarization style, open the Prompt template and adjust the tone or persona **(e.g., “Write an executive summary” or “Summarize in bullet points”).**
- You can chain additional evaluation nodes for advanced comparison of results.
- Use the **Results leaderboard** in the \*\*optimizer \*\*to monitor which prompt performs best.
