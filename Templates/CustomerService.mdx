title: "Customer Service "

This advanced LLM Controls template provides an AI-powered customer support system that uses your uploaded company documents to deliver personalized, context-aware responses to user queries.

\
It integrates Prompt Optimization, Vector Search, and LLMC Executor to create a fully automated support flow.

## **Prerequisites**

- An active OpenAI API key
- Access to the LLM Controls dashboard
- At least one support document (PDF, TXT, or website URL) for data ingestion

## **Create the Customer Service Flow**

From the LLM Controls dashboard, click **New Flow → Select Customer Service – Advanced.**\
The flow includes three main sections:

### **1. Prompt Optimizer Flow**

Automatically generate, evaluate, and rank optimized prompts to ensure your model responds effectively to customer questions.

#### **Flow Components**

1. **User Task** – Define the type of prompt you want to optimize.
2. **Prompt Optimization Engine** – Generates variations, criteria, and scoring to identify the best prompt.
3. ****Results – Displays ranked performance and top prompt outputs.****

#### **Run It**

- Start from the **User Task node**, input your optimization goal.
- Click Run on the Results node to execute the optimizer.
- Review the leaderboard to see the top-performing prompt.

### **2. Load Data Flow**

Prepare your knowledge base for AI retrieval. This step embeds your support documents into a Vector DB.

#### **Steps**

1. **Upload Files** or URLs – Add your customer support guides, FAQs, or product documentation.
2. **Split Text** – Breaks content into smaller chunks.
3. **Embed Text** – Uses OpenAI Embeddings to create vector representations.
4. **Store Data** – Saves all embeddings to the LLMC Vector DB.

   <Info>
     Make sure your OpenAI API key is configured in the embedding component.

### **3. Retriever Flow**

Handles real customer queries using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

#### **How It Works**

1. The **Chat Input** collects a user question.
2. The **Vector DB** retrieves relevant support content.
3. The **Prompt injects** that context into the model request.
4. The **LLMC Executor** generates the final AI-powered response.

#### **Example**

**Input**: “Why was my refund delayed?”\
**Output**: “Your refund was delayed due to a pending bank verification step, as stated in our policy.”

### **4. LLMC Executor**

Executes optimized prompts using selected models (like GPT-4o).

#### **Usage Steps**

1. Select your Prompt and Model.
2. Ensure your API Key is active.
3. Enter the user query and click  Play.
4. View the generated response in the Output section.

## **Run the Full Customer Support Flow**

1. Load and embed your company data via the Load Data Flow.
2. Optimize prompts with the Prompt Optimizer Flow.
3. Connect the Retriever Flow for live Q&A.
4. Test everything in the Playground to verify responses.

   <Tip>
     You can further fine-tune prompts or connect different model endpoints for performance testing.
   </Tip>

## **Modify and Extend**

- Add custom prompt templates for tone or brand voice.
- Integrate additional embedding sources (e.g., Notion, Confluence).
- Chain multiple LLMC Executors for tiered reasoning.
