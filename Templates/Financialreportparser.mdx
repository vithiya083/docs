Build a **Financial Report Parser** flow with the [Structured output](https://docs.llmcontrols.ai/Components/Helpers#structured-output) and [Parser](https://docs.llmcontrols.ai/Components/Processing#parser) components to parse LLM responses into a structured format.

In this example, the **Chat Input** component is pre-loaded with a sample financial report to demonstrate extracting `Gross Profit`, `EBITDA`, and `Net Income`.

## **Prerequisites**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/financial-report-parser#prerequisites)

- [An OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/)

## **Create the financial report parser flow**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/financial-report-parser#create-the-financial-report-parser-flow)

1. From the LLM Controls dashboard, click **New Flow**.
2. Select **Financial Report Parser**.

The **Financial Report Parser** flow is created.

## **Run the memory chatbot flow**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/financial-report-parser#run-the-memory-chatbot-flow)

1. Add your OpenAI API key to the OpenAI model.
2. Click the **Playground** button, and then click **Send**. The **Chat Input** component is pre-loaded with a sample financial report for demonstration purposes.

   ```
   
   SAMPLE: In 2025, the company demonstrated strong financial performance, reporting a gross profit of $1.2 billion, reflecting stable revenue generation and effective cost management. 
   The EBITDA stood at $900 million, highlighting the company’s solid operational efficiency and profitability before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
   Despite a slight increase in operating expenses compared to 2021, the company maintained a healthy bottom line, achieving a net income of $500 million. 
   This growth underscores the company’s ability to navigate economic challenges while sustaining profitability, reinforcing its financial stability and competitive position in the market.
   ```

   The chat returns a structured response:

   ```
   
   EBITIDA: 900 million, Net Income: 500 million, GROSS_PROFIT: 1.2 billion 
   ```

Inspect the flow to understand how this information was extracted.

3. To inspect the output schema table, in the **Structured Output** component, click **Open table**. The **Structured Output** component uses the attached **OpenAI** model component as its "brain" to extract financial data into a [DataFrame](https://docs.llmcontrols.ai/Concepts/LLMCobjects#dataframe-object%E2%80%8B) with this defined schema.
4. To inspect the template that contains the extracted data, in the **Parser** component, click the **Scan** icon in the **Template** field. The **Parser** component converts the extracted data into formatted messages for chat consumption. Each variable receives its value from the structured outputs.
