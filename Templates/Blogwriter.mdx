Build a Blog Writer flow for a one-shot application using OpenAI.

This flow extends the Basic Prompting flow with the **URL** and **Parser** components that fetch content from multiple URLs and convert the loaded data into plain text.

OpenAI uses this loaded data to generate a blog post, as instructed by the **Text Input** and **Prompt** components.

## **Prerequisites**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/blog-writer#prerequisites)

- [A running Langflow instance](https://docs.langflow.org/get-started-installation)
- [An OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/)

## **Create the blog writer flow**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/blog-writer#create-the-blog-writer-flow)

1. From the Langflow dashboard, click **New Flow**.
2. Select **Blog Writer**.
3. The **Blog Writer** flow is created.

This flow creates a blog article generator with **Prompt**, **OpenAI**, and **Chat Output** components, augmented with reference content and instructions from the **URL** and **Text Input** components.

The **URL** component extracts raw text and metadata from one or more web links. The **Parser** component converts the data coming from the **URL** component into plain text to feed the prompt.

To examine the flow's prompt, click the **Template** field of the **Prompt** component.

```
```

Now that your query has completed the journey from **Chat input** to **Chat output**, you have completed the **Simple Agent** flow.
