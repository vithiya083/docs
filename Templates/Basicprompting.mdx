title: "Basic prompting"
---

Prompts serve as the inputs to a large language model (LLM), acting as the interface between human instructions and computational tasks.

By submitting natural language requests in a prompt to an LLM, you can obtain answers, generate text, and solve problems.

This article demonstrates how to use LLMControls' prompt tools to issue basic prompts to an LLM and how various prompting strategies can affect your outcomes.

## **Prerequisites**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/basic-prompting#prerequisites)

- [An OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/)

## **Create the basic prompting flow**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/basic-prompting#create-the-basic-prompting-flow)

1. From the LLMControls dashboard, click **New Flow**.
2. Select **Basic Prompting**.
3. The **Basic Prompting** flow is created.

This flow allows you to chat with the **OpenAI model** component. The model will respond according to the prompt constructed in the **Prompt** component.

4. To examine the **Template**, in the **Prompt** component, click the **Template** field.
5. As in early stage , we provide API key to test your application .
6. To use your own API key,  an environment variable for the \*\*custom \*\*component, in the **custom API Key** field, click the  **Globe** button, and then click **Add New Variable**.
   1. In the **Variable Name** field, enter `custom_api_key`.
   2. In the **Value** field, paste your custom API Key (`sk-...`).
   3. Click **Save Variable**.

## **Run the basic prompting flow**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/basic-prompting#run-the-basic-prompting-flow)

1. Click the **Playground** button.
2. Type a message and press Enter. The bot should respond in a markedly piratical manner\!

## **Modify the prompt for a different result**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/basic-prompting#modify-the-prompt-for-a-different-result)

1. To modify your prompt results, in the **Prompt** component, click the **Template** field. The **Edit Prompt** window opens.
2. Change the existing prompt to a different character, perhaps `Answer the user as if you were Hermione Granger.`
3. Run the workflow again and notice how the prompt changes the model's response.
