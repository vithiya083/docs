Issues Summary

Total Issues Found: 8

High Severity: 0

Medium Severity: 2

Low Severity: 6


Issues Details :


1. [LOW] inconsistent: The 'Report Date' is listed as December 16, 2025, which is 8 months after the 'Proposal Deadline' of April 17, 2025. This appears to be a typo in the report metadata (likely intended to be 2024 or early 2025), though it does not affect the accuracy of the extracted RFP facts.


2. [LOW] inconsistent: Report Date logic error: Header states 'December 16, 2025', but Executive Summary states the April 17, 2025 deadline is '4 months from current date', implying the report was generated in December 2024. The Report Date year is likely a typo.


3. [LOW] missing: Core facts (Budget: $10M, Deadline: April 17, 2025) are included in the report but are not present in the provided RFP text snippet. While likely retrieved via external research (as permitted), they cannot be verified against the provided source text.


4. [LOW] incorrect: Report Date is listed as 'December 16, 2025', but the Proposal Deadline is 'April 17, 2025'. The report body states the deadline is '4 months from the current date', implying the report date should be December 2024.


5. [LOW] inconsistent: Report Date is listed as 'December 16, 2025', but the content states the 'April 17, 2025' deadline is '4 months from current date', implying the report was actually generated in December 2024. The year 2025 in the header appears to be a typo.


6. [MEDIUM] missing: RFP Section F.15 explicitly states that 'Failure to provide the statement on potential conflicts of interest will automatically disqualify the Offeror.' This critical compliance requirement (and its disqualification penalty) is missing from the Compliance & Risk Assessment section.


7. [MEDIUM] missing: The AI report fails to mention the specific '10-year' insurance tail coverage requirement for construction projects following final acceptance (Original RFP Section c), which is a significant long-term cost/compliance factor.


8. [LOW] missing: The AI report does not list the specific Point of Contact (Karen M. Hester) or the submission address provided in the Original RFP text (Section h), though it correctly identifies the agency (DC PSC).
