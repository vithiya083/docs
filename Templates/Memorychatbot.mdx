  The **Chat memory** component is also known as the **Message history** component.
</Info>

This flow extends the [basic prompting flow](https://docs.langflow.org/basic-prompting) with a **Message history** component that stores up to 100 previous chat messages and uses them to provide context for the current conversation.

## **Prerequisites**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/memory-chatbot#prerequisites)

- [A running Langflow instance](https://docs.langflow.org/get-started-installation)
- [An OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/)

## **Create the memory chatbot flow**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/memory-chatbot#create-the-memory-chatbot-flow)

1. From the Langflow dashboard, click **New Flow**.
2. Select **Memory Chatbot**.
3. The **Memory Chatbot** flow is created.

This flow adds a **Message history** component to the Basic Prompting flow. This component retrieves previous messages and sends them to the **Prompt** component to fill a part of the **Template** with context.

To examine the template, click the **Template** field in the **Prompt** component. The **Prompt** tells the **OpenAI model** component how to respond to input.

```
```

The `{memory}` code in the prompt creates a new input port in the component called **memory**. The **Message history** component is connected to this port to store chat messages from the **Playground**, and provide the **OpenAI** component with a memory of previous chat messages.

## **Run the memory chatbot flow**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/memory-chatbot#run-the-memory-chatbot-flow)

1. Open the **Playground**.
2. Enter multiple questions. For example, try entering this conversation:

```
```

The chatbot remembers your name and previous questions.

3. To view the **Message Logs** pane, click , and then click **Message Logs**. The **Message Logs** pane displays all previous messages, with each conversation sorted by `session_id`.

## **Use Session ID with the memory chatbot flow**[**​**](https://docs.langflow.org/memory-chatbot#use-session-id-with-the-memory-chatbot-flow)

`session_id` is a unique identifier in Langflow that stores conversation sessions between the AI and a user. A `session_id` is created when a conversation is initiated, and then associated with all subsequent messages during that session.

In the **Memory Chatbot** flow you created, the **Message history** component references past interactions by **Session ID**. You can demonstrate this by modifying the **Session ID** value to switch between conversation histories.

1. In the **Session ID** field of the **Message history** and **Chat Input** components, add a **Session ID** value like `MySessionID`.
2. Now, once you send a new message the **Playground**, you should have a new memory created in the **Message Logs** pane.
3. Notice how your conversation is being stored in different memory sessions.
