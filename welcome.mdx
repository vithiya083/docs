LLM Controls is a new, visual framework for building multi-agent and RAG applications.

LLM Controls is a platform designed to simplify the deployment and integration of language model workflows. It enables developers to turn LLM-based logic into reusable flows that can be queried through APIs, embedded in websites, or run inside applications.\
\
It offers a structured way to connect prompts, tools, and logic into a single visual flow. These flows are modular, shareable, and production-ready, making it easier to scale language model solutions without rebuilding the same infrastructure every time.\
\
With LLM Controls, you can power intelligent chatbots, automate document understanding, build custom knowledge agents, or trigger actions based on text input. It’s flexible enough for experiments and robust enough for production systems.

## **Visual flow builder**

LLM Controls is an intuitive visual flow builder. This drag-and-drop interface allows developers to create complex AI workflows without writing extensive code. You can easily connect different components, such as prompts, language models, and data sources, to build sophisticated AI applications.
